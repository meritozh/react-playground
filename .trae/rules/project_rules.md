principle:
1. create low level reusable react component to building chart, such as axis, tooltip, area, shape
2. try to reuse component to create any new chart


additions:
1. try to learn how visx package implement, whch leverage react and d3, has built bunch high quality components
2. try to implement high performance react component, such as less useEffect, atomic update
3. all code should placed under apps/<project>
